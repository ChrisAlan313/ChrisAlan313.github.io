## About

I'm Chris Booty. I’m a Software Engineer at [Boatsetter](https://www.boatsetter.com), working on a Frontend
Platform team. Before writing software, I spent 8 years in QA at Boatsetter and went through
a Ruby on Rails boot camp in 2015.

I care about simplicity, clarity, and doing things the right way. I value
test-driven development, modern CI/CD, and trunk-based delivery. I favor mature
tools and proven patterns over hype or novelty.

I’m curious about systems—both technical and cultural—and I spend time studying
the tools I use, the assumptions behind them, and how to improve them. Outside
of work, I explore topics like English, anthropology, survival gardening, time,
and Bigfoot.

## Projects

I’m currently building a terminal-based JavaScript game where the player
explores a world shaped like a cube. It’s a focused exercise in game loops,
input handling, and ASCII rendering.

Most of my professional work is not publicly available, but I’m actively
working to change that.
